17) Write a program to execute ls -l | wc.
	a) Use dup
	b) Use dup2
	c) use fcntl
*/

/*
Steps in 17a.c depend on the assumption that file descriptors 0, 1, and 2 for a process are already open. (The shell normally ensures this for each program it executes.) If file descriptor 0 was already closed prior to the above steps, then we would erroneously bind the processâ€™s standard input to the write end of the pipe. To avoid this possibility, we can replace the calls to close() and dup() with the following dup2() call, which allows us to explicitly specify the descriptor to be bound to the pipe end
